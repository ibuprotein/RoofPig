  <h2>Offline demo</h2>
  <p>
    The original roofpig demos are at jsfiddle.net
    They are no longer operational, because they tried to load the roofpig_and_three.js over http.
    Therefore, I downloaded the demo file so I can run them offline.
  </p><p>
    The demo files refer to the roofpig JS file at the root of this repo.
    The script has non-ANSI characters, and most browsers will not like it.
    To browse the demo locally, you may need to manually add BOM at the start of the file.
    A bom.txt is included under /lib for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, I added an extra demo file for the changes I made to the repo.
