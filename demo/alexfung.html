<h2>alexfung commits demo</h2>
<p>
  This demo page shows the effects of the commits on the alexfung branch,
  which is a fork of the 1.4 master.
</p><p>
  The demo files refer to the roofpig JS file at the root of this repo.
  That file is not exactly the same as the output of the build process.
  The roofpig JS file contains non-ANSI characters and may confuse browsers.
  I have added BOM to the roofpig JS file at the root of this repo to make sure browsers know it is a UTF-8 file.

<h3>Color Fix</h3>
<p>
  In 1.4 (and 1.5P) color is not assigned correctly if alg= includes any M/E/S slice movement or x/y/z rotation.
  Fixed in the color fix commit.
</p>
<div class="roofpig" data-config="alg=U| colored=*|flags=showalg startsolved">Normal: U on top</div>
<div class="roofpig" data-config="alg=M| colored=*|flags=showalg startsolved|algdisplay=rotations">color fix for M</div>
<div class="roofpig" data-config="alg=x| colored=*|flags=showalg startsolved|algdisplay=rotations">color fix for X</div>


<h3>Rotations: X vs R&gt; vs Ra</h3>

<p>
  It came to my notice that the two types of rotations are not identical.
  <ul>
    <li>
      X/Y/Z are macros for combo moves. 
      For example, X&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;R&oplus;M<sup>-1</sup>&oplus;L<sup>-1</sup>.
      After X/Y/Z, U is still on top.
    </li>
    <li>
      R&gt; etc moves the camera angle.
      It allows you to view the cube from another direction.
      After this kind of rotations, U moves the same face as if the rotation never happened.
    </li>
  </ul>
  It is easier to understand with examples:
</p>
<div class="roofpig" data-config="alg=x U| colored=*|flags=showalg startsolved|algdisplay=rotations">U is still on top</div>

<div class="roofpig" data-config="alg=R> U| colored=*|flags=showalg startsolved|algdisplay=rotations">U not on top</div>
<p style='clear:left'>
  I keep the current hebaviour without making any changes.
  I don't need R&gt; at all, and I found that X is too diffult to understand.
  So I added a new set of accepted input alg= 
  <ul>
    <li>Ra&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;X</li>
    <li>Ua&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;Y</li>
    <li>Fa&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;Z</li>
    <li>La&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;X<sup>-1</sup></li>
    <li>Da&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;Y<sup>-1</sup></li>
    <li>Ba&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;Z<sup>-1</sup></li>
  </ul>
</p><p>
  I think my names are much easier to understand.
  Following the style of Rw (rotate double rows),
  I use Ra to mean moving all three planes.
  Ra moves the cube in the same direction as R,
  La moves the cube in the same direction as L.

<div class="roofpig" data-config="alg=Ra La Fa Ba Ua Da|solved=undefined|flags=startsolved showalg|algdisplay=rotation fancy-1s xyzUpper">Rotations: Ra La Fa Ba Ua Da</div>
